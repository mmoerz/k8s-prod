# My cluster architecture

This should describe my cluster architecture. I didn't follow the best
practise to use 3 nodes for ... and another 3 nodes for running the workload.


Currently I have got a cluster with four nodes.
The ... layer is on kube1, kube2 and kube3.
Machines are run on kube1 to kube4. 
So there is no split up of the ... plane.
