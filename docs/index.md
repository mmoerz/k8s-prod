# Infrastructure 

contains basic information about my infrastructure

## Hardware

a few facts about the hardware i use:

### kube1 and kube2

  * cpu: Intel i5-4590T
  * ram: 8GB
  * hdd: 500 GB TOSHIBA MQ02ABF050H

### kube3 and kube4

  * cpu: Intel i5-4590T
  * ram: 8GB
  * ssd: 128GB KingFast

As can be infered that are small formfactor pcs that I 'misuse' as cluster 
nodes. Even their storage is different across nodes. 

Before faning the flame even further, this is my private setup and therefore 
cost was the driving decission factor here.

## Hardware preparations
In order to prepare the settop boxes I upgraded the bios to its latest and
greatest available version using a usbkey with freeDos.

IMPORTANT HINT: don't remove the usbKey while rebooting - this can give a
deadly mixup in the bios preventing the UEFI to properly find the bootdisk
